### `4 OOP concepts in Java`
1. **Abstraction**
- Abstraction aims to `hide complexity` from users and show them `only relevant information`. For example, if you’re driving a car, you don’t need to know about its internal workings.
 
2. **Encapsulation**
- The practice of keeping fields within a `class private`, then providing access to those fields via `public methods`. Encapsulation is a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself.

3. **Inheritance**
- Inheritance lets programmers create new classes that share some of the attributes of existing classes using keyword `extends`.

4. **Polymorphism**
- Polymorphism refers to the ability to perform a certain action in different ways
- In Java, polymorphism can take two forms: method `overloading` and method `overriding`.
