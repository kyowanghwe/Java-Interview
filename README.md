### `4 OOP concepts in Java`
1.**Abstraction**
  Abstraction aims to hide complexity from users and show them only relevant information. For example, if you’re driving a car, you don’t need to know about its internal workings. \
2.**Encapsulation**
  The practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to those fields via public methods. Encapsulation is a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. \
3.**Inheritance**
